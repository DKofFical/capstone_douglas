Vincent exited the playroom. Erik, always the pessimistic one, saw an opportunity to rid himself of the apple that reminded him of his friend's fondness for it. With a determined scowl on his face, he carefully picked up the apple and swiftly made his way to the trash can. He didn't want it to go to waste, nor did he want Vincent to enjoy it.
