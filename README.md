Please refer to "project_code.ipynb" for the main code of my project. This Jupyter Notebook includes a step-by-step guide of how to produce all the results in my report. 

The file "bigtom_story_scenarios.csv" is a processed version of all 200 story scenarios in the BigToM dataset.

The file "labelled_processed_percepts.csv" is a processed, filtered, and labelled version of the percept cues I have generated for my evaluation framework.

The folder "prompt_templates" refers to all the prompt templates I have used in the project. There are two prompt templates for story generation, four prompt templates for Task 1, and four prompt templates for Task 2.

The folder "evaluation_results" stores the evaluation results for Tasks 1 and 2. Files with the suffix "_total" store the number of times the LLM is queried for each percept cue, and files with the suffix "_correct" store the number of instances where the LLM answered the queries correctly.
