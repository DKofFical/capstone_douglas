Instructions: Based on the following story and event, generate perceptual cues that the main character might encounter, which MUST challenge their belief. Each cue should be creative, reasonable, and systematically explore the sensory modalities of: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, thermoception (sense of temperature about objects), proprioception (sense of body position/weight), social perception. Be descriptive and only make vivid descriptions about the perceptual cue, without describing the main character's thoughts. Avoid making explicit comparisons between the event and the main character's belief. Generate 2 perceptual cues for each sensory modality. Be super duper creative! Do not use these words: different, difference, instead of, contrasts.\n For each cue, write your output in a format like this example: \n ### Visual Cues\n1.
